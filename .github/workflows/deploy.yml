    #     role-to-assume: # optional
    #     # AWS Access Key ID. Provide this key if you want to assume a role using access keys rather than a web identity token.

    #     web-identity-token-file: # optional
    #     # Use existing credentials from the environment to assume a new role, rather than providing credentials as input.
    #     role-chaining: # optional
    #     # The audience to use for the OIDC provider
    #     audience: # optional, default is sts.amazonaws.com
    #     # Proxy to use for the AWS SDK agent

    #     # Whether to disable the retry and backoff mechanism when the assume role call fails. By default the retry mechanism is enabled
    #     disable-retry: # optional
    #     # The maximum number of attempts it will attempt to retry the assume role call. By default it will retry 12 times
    #     retry-max-attempts: # optional
    #     # Some environments do not support special characters in AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. This option will retry fetching credentials until the secret access key does not contain special characters. This option overrides disable-retry and retry-max-attempts. This option is disabled by default
    #     special-characters-workaround: # optional
    #     # When enabled, this option will check if there are already valid credentials in the environment. If there are, new credentials will not be fetched. If there are not, the action will run as normal.
    #     use-existing-credentials: # optional
